# Get the System

Download or purchase Elementary OS from here: [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/)

# Get the Bootable Pen Drive
You can use Rufus, Universal USB Installer, or Image Burner, but I prefer to use Etcher to that, and you can download it 
from here: [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

## How to use Balena Etcher

After install just open it, select the system iso, the right pen drive and click "Flash!". Wait until the process end and 
then close the program.

# Configure the BIOS and Start Formatting

Now shut down your computer, plug your pen drive and acess the BIOS, usually its by pressing F2, F10, F11 or DEL.
But if that dont work for you search for your motherboard or laptop model and see how do you get into the BIOS.

## Disable Secure Boot

Already in the BIOS if your PC is old you need to disable the secure boot,but if not you can jump to the next step.

## Change Boot Order

Browse through the BIOS and make sure that your USB is the first of boot order.
Now just save the config and restart the computer with the USB plugged and the logo of Elementary Os will blink in your
screen.

Choosing to erase disk and install elementary this pop-up will appear to advise that you will lose all the data and 
partitions of your HD. So with that on mind click "Continue".

## 5.2-

Choosing to install alongside other system the other step is slice your HD/SSD with this bar. Just divide how much of your 
space will be use to the 2 system. Tip: if you are using Elemetary OS just to learn how it works something between 20 and 
50GB is more than enough.

Next you just need to fill with your personal information. Tip for the password try to choose something with at most 8 or 10 
characters cause you will need to write this a lot of times in the terminal, app center and many others.
